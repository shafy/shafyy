In this blog post series, I'm diving deep into the technical details of virtual reality headsets and try to explain as simply as possible how they work. I'll be releasing new parts as I go. This first part aims to give a general overview of the basics of VR headsets. The subsequent parts will then focus on specific aspects.

Hopefully, this series brings you the core concepts behind VR closer and gives you an idea of how VR will continue develop in the near future and what the challenges are.

I'm going to focus on 6 degrees of freedom, stand-alone (also called mobile, or all-in-one) VR headsets such as the Oculus Quest or the HTC Vive Focus. These are headsets that don't need a PC or external sensors to run. Of course, a lot of the technology in stand-alone and PC VR headsets are similar. The main difference is that PC VR headsets realy heavily on the CPU and GPU of the connected computer to do the heavy lifting, and therefore are more powerful. In stand-alone headsets, everything is done on-board.

Let's get started.

A VR headsets contains all components that all computers (such as laptops and smartphones) also contain. The basic components of a computer are the CPU (central processing unit) and a memory to store data. Like most modern computers, VR headsets also contain a GPU (graphics processing unit) that helps to increase performance when displaying images. Which, obviously, is quite important for a VR headset.

Unlike the 2D screens we are used to on our laptops and phones, a VR headset needs to create 3D images somehow. Or at least fool our eyes and brain to think that we are in a different 3D world. This is done with optical lenses.

In fact, VR headsets use "normal" screens. For example, the Quest has an OLED screen, while the Oculus Rift S has an LCD screen. That screen is located only a couple of centimeters in front of your eyes, but the lenses distort the photons that are emitted from the screen, changing the path of the light and the angle they hit your eyes. Your brain uses a variety of cues to orient itself in space. VR headsets simulate these cues to create the immersiveness.
