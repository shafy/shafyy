I recently added a new feature to Fugu which let's you select a date range for your data. It looks like this:

<video width="100%" controls>
  <source src="/videos/fugu_date_range_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

As you can see, you can select between 5 pre-defined date ranges: *Last 7 days*, *Last 30 days*, *This month*, *Last 6 months*, and *Last 12 months*. I think the pre-defined ranges come in very handy and cover a lot of use cases. No worries, I will soon also add the ability to select a custom date range.

If you're looking for a simple and privacy-friendly products anylytics solution and haven't tried Fugu yet, head over to [fugu.lol](https://fugu.lol) to give it a whirl.
