I predict that Facebook will host Oculus Connect 7 in Facebook Horizon this year.

Facebook has already announced that OC7 will happen in a digital format due to the Corona Virus. I think it's also safe to assume that they will want to do it in VR one way or another. Of course, they could just stream it on a VR 2D screen in Oculus Venues. Or, they could use their newely launching social VR platform Facebook Horizon to host it.

Horizon is poised to launch some time this year, and it would make a lot of sense for them to make sure it's live for OC7 and use it to host it, too.

What do you think?
