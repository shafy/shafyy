In this essay, I posit that the importance of a computing platform is strongly correlated to its potential to generate economic value.

Why is this correlation key? I think it helps to predict the importance and future growth of a computing platform very early on.

Let's start with some definitions and examples.

What is a computing platform? Here, we define computing platform in a narrowly, meaning not a specific hardware or software system, but the underlying technology in general. For instance, personal computers are a computing platform, not the subcategories of it (i.e. NOT hardware or opearting system makers such as Apple or iOS).

What do I mean by the potential to generate economic value? I mean the potential cash people and organizations can make by using this computing platform. This is cash they couldn't otherwise make, so it's to be understood as incremental cash. Therefore, this economic value for society as only generated *because* of this computing platform.

In the recent past and present, I would consider the following computing platforms: personal computers (PC), laptops, tablets, virtual reality, the internet, social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, blockchain, PDAs like the Palm, smartwatches and wearables, gaming consoles.

Let's group these computing technologies into categories to better analyze the economic value.


##Internet, PCs and laptops: Enormous economic value

##Social Media: Moderate economic value that's declining

##Tablets, smartwatches, wearables and gaming consoles: Small economic value

##Virtual reality and blockchain: Potential economic value in the future?
