Hey hey! My name is Can Olcer. I'm currently working on two open-source projects: [Fugu](https://fugu.lol), a privacy-friendly product analytics software, and [Mapzy](https://mapzy.io), a store locator.


Previously I created a school that exists only in VR (didn't work out), a plant-based cheese company (didn't work out either) and co-founded a company called [Chimpy](https://heychimpy.com) (worked out).

I was born and raised in Zurich, Switzerland and currently live in Berlin, Germany.

This site uses [web monetization](https://webmonetization.org). Not because I expect to make significant amounts of dough, but because I want that this way of paying publishers becomes more commonplace. For example, users can use a service like [Coil](https://coil.com) that automatically distributes a monthly amount among sites which the user visited. Technology-wise, they use the open protocol [Interledger](https://interledger.org) which implements the Web Monetization API. And no, Interledger has nothing to do with blockchain.
