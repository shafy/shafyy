My name is Can Olcer. I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur. I'm working on a fun educational VR game (at [Kosmos School](https://kosmosschool.com), together with [Dorena](https://twitter.com/dorenanagel)).

We also run a side project called [Froggodoggo](https://froggodoggo.com) that brings together founders looking for a side gig to finance their startup and companies looking to hire them as part-time software engineers.

Before starting Kosmos School, I co-founded a company based in Zurich called [Chimpy](https://heychimpy.com/). At Chimpy, I'm responsible for product management.

I was born and raised in Zurich, Switzerland.
