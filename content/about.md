Hey hey! My name is Can Olcer. I'm currently working on two open-source projects: [Fugu](https://fugu.lol), a privacy-friendly product analytics software, and [Mapzy](https://github.com/mapzy/mapzy), a store finder.

I also make plant-based cheese ([Yeti](https://yetifoods.de)).

Previously I created a school that exists only in VR (which didn't work out) and co-founded a company called [Chimpy](https://heychimpy.com).

I was born and raised in Zurich, Switzerland and currently live in Berlin, Germany.

This site uses web monetization. Not because I would make a lot of money, but because I want that this way of paying publishers becomes more commonplace. The idea is that users pay a fixed monthly fee to a service provider like [Coil](https://coil.com) which uses the open protocol Interledger. The money then gets distributed to publishers based on how much time the user spent on Interledger supported websites.
