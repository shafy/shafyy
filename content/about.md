Hey hey! My name is Can Olcer. I make plant-based cheese ([Yeti](https://yeticheese.com)).

Previously I co-founded a company based in Zurich called [Chimpy](https://heychimpy.com) and also tried to make a school that exists only in VR (which didn't work out).

I was born and raised in Zurich, Switzerland.

You can contact me here: canolcer@hey.com
