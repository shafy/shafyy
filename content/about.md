Hey hey! My name is Can Olcer.

I'm the co-founder of [Ravioli](https://getravioli.de), where we make it simple for e-commerce merchants to ship their products in reusable packaging and thereby cut their CO2 emissions and waste. If you run an online shop in Germany, don't hesitate to reach out.

I'm also the co-creator of two open-source projects: [Fugu](https://github.com/shafy/fugu), a privacy-friendly product analytics software, and [Mapzy](https://github.com/mapzy/mapzy), a store locator.

Previously I created a school that exists only in VR (didn't work out), a plant-based cheese company (didn't work out either) and co-founded a company called [Chimpy](https://heychimpy.com) (worked out).

I was born and raised in Zurich, Switzerland and currently live in Hamburg, Germany.

You can contact me here: canolcer@hey.com
