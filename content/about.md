My name is Can Olcer. I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur. Currently, I'm running a startup that I co-founded called [Kosmos School](https://kosmosschool.com). Our mission is to prove that virtual reality is a key technology to significantly improve K-12 education.

I was born and raised in Zurich, Switzerland.

Before founding Kosmos, I co-founded a startup in Zurich called [Chimpy](https://heychimpy.com/).
