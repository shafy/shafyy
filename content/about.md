My name is Can Olcer. I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur. I create nerdy VR games (at [Kosmos School](https://kosmosschool.com), together with [Dorena](https://twitter.com/dorenanagel)).


Before starting Kosmos School, I co-founded a company based in Zurich called [Chimpy](https://heychimpy.com/).

I was born and raised in Zurich, Switzerland.
